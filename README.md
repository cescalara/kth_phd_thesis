# kth_phd_thesis

PhD thesis LaTeX template fulfilling the ["graphic profile"](https://intra.kth.se/en/administration/kommunikation/mallar/mallar-for-nedladdning-1.458701) of KTH. 

Adapted from an older template passed down through students in my PhD research group.

The document `thesis_demo.tex` should show how everything is done, and if using glossaries, don't forget to run `makegloassaries thesis_demo` in the root directory.

NB: The cover page included here is just a placeholder and the actual cover must be made by the printers, as described [here](https://www.kth.se/en/student/program/examensarbete/avhandlingarochexamensarbeten).
